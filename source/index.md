# Introduction

Welcome to the official Ryver API documentation. Our APIs allow 3rd parties
to integrate to Ryver with greater flexibility than what is supported by
services such Zapier. Ryverâ€™s APIs are a subset of
[OData 2.0](http://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-2-0/) and will be
familiar to someone with experience using REST HTTP APIs.

## The Basics

The Ryver API is predominantly resource-oriented with a small number of
RPC-style end points to perform more complex actions. [Cross-origin resource
sharing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) is supported
to provide access to our API from web clients. [JSON](http://www.json.org) is
returned for all resource requests.

<pre class="inline"><code>
http://host/path/odata.svc/users(1)?$top=2&$orderby=Name
\________________________/\_______/ \__________________/
             |                |               |
         base path      resource path    query options
</code></pre>

# Authentication

> To authenticate using curl:

```shell
curl -X POST -u user:pass "https://test.ryver.com/api/1/odata.svc/Session.Login()"
```

> Typical response

```json
{
  "username": "Stu",
  "id": 75,
  "sessionId": "develop:75:6b2e6516971b23910d75ef91b43fe7eaf3706675",
  "instanceId": "develop",
  "newUser": false,
  "__descriptor": "Stuart Carnie"
}
```

A consumer must first authenticate with the Ryver API using HTTP Basic
authentication over [HTTPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure), by
calling the `/api/1/odata.svc/Session.Login()` API.

<aside class="notice">
Upon successful verification of credentials, the server will respond with
information about the authenticated user, including a <code>sessionId</code>
that should be used in subsequent requests.
</aside>

The `sessionId` should be paired with a header named `Contatta-Session` as
follows

> Using the `Contatta-Session` header

```shell
curl "http://develop.contatta.vm/api/1/odata.svc/Session.GetCurrentUser()" \
     -H "Contatta-Session: develop:75:6b2e6516971b23910d75ef91b43fe7eaf3706675"
```
